- 👋 Hi, welcome to my Dev space
- 🔐 Passionate about secure software development, fintech platforms, and building resilient applications.
- 🎯 **Aspiring Cybersecurty (Fintech Application Security Engineer) 
- 🎯 **Finance & Credit Risk Analysis| Financial Digital Products @Enchepata | Management Reporting | Credit-Tech Strategist | Web&App Dev | Pursuing Cybersecurity**

- Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a finance and analytics professional specializing in management reporting and credit risk analysis, with a strong command of data-driven tools and technologies. I have a keen interest in integrating technology to streamline reporting, automate processes, and enhance risk evaluation frameworks and I am committed to driving value at the intersection of finance, analytics, and innovation. 

## 🚀 What I Do
- 📊 Create dynamic **management reports** and **financial dashboards** that support executive decision-making
- 📊 **Data Privacy & Risk Dashboards**  - I build dashboards for financial data risk profiling, anonymization, and compliance monitoring using Excel, Notion, Python, and JavaScript — tailored for SMEs and digital lenders.
- 💳 **Build & Assess Credit-Driven Systems** - With a strong foundation in credit analysis and financial systems, I bridge the gap between risk assessment and secure technical implementation. I design tools and processes that ensure data protection, compliance (e.g. PCI DSS, GDPR), and trust in lending platforms.
